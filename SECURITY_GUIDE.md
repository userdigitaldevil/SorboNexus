# SorboNexus Security Guide

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **HTTPS/SSL**

- Render automatically provides SSL certificates
- All production traffic is encrypted
- Update your frontend API calls to use `https://` in production

### 2. **Security Headers (Helmet)**

- XSS Protection
- Content Security Policy
- Frame Options (prevents clickjacking)
- Content Type Sniffing Protection
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

### 3. **Rate Limiting**

- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Authentication routes: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Prevents brute force attacks and DDoS

### 4. **CORS Configuration**

- Restricts origins to trusted domains only
- Different settings for development vs production
- Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

### 5. **Enhanced Authentication**

- JWT token validation with proper error handling
- Token expiration (7 days)
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Admin-only registration (disabled public registration)

### 6. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

- Request payload size limits (10MB)
- MongoDB injection protection via Mongoose
- Input sanitization in models

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Render environment:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

### Frontend Security

1. **API Base URL**: Update to use HTTPS in production
2. **Token Storage**: Store JWT in httpOnly cookies or secure localStorage
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs on frontend
4. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user-generated content

### Database Security

1. **MongoDB Atlas**: Use IP whitelist for database access
2. **Connection String**: Use environment variables
3. **Backup**: Enable automatic backups
4. **Monitoring**: Set up database monitoring

### Domain Security

1. **DNS Security**: Use DNSSEC
2. **Email Security**: Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
3. **Subdomain Security**: Secure all subdomains

## üîß Security Checklist

### Before Production

- [ ] All environment variables set in Render
- [ ] HTTPS enabled and working
- [ ] CORS origins updated with your domain
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Security headers active
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] JWT secret is strong and unique

### Ongoing Security

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security audit logs
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Backup verification
- [ ] SSL certificate renewal (automatic with Render)

## üö® Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor

- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database connection errors

### Alerts to Set Up

- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual traffic spikes
- SSL certificate expiration
- Database performance issues

## üìû Security Contacts

- **Domain Registrar**: For domain security issues
- **Render Support**: For hosting security
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For database security
- **Your Email**: For security reports

## üîÑ Security Updates

This guide should be updated whenever:

- New security features are added
- Dependencies are updated
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- New deployment environments are added
